# PPI-SARS-CoV2
Understanding what host proteins are interacting with the viral proteins can give us insights on the mechanisms of virus infecting the cells and can potentially lead to drug targets. To understand such host-pathogen interactions, there have been many studies that look at protein-protein interactions (PPI) using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS).  Using the AP-MS method, recently, UCSF scientists have identified the human proteins that are physically associated with each of the 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. 

At the end of this project, symposium slides were created and presented, which are also included for reference. Additionally, for a detailed project introduction and description, refer to the project description. The raw multipathogen protein-protein interaction data supplied by UCSF's Krogan Lab is accessible in the PPI main folder.
